# BT_missingdata
This repository includes custom scripts for data analysis for the paper: Genetic influences on missing data across experimental measures in infancy.

Analyses focus on the investigation of the etiological influences on missing data across different experiments in developmental cognitive neuroscience, using data from the Babytwins Study Sweden (BATSS).

Scripts cover preparation of twin data for modelling, multivariate twin modelling, univariate twin modelling (testing trial level missingness), univariate liability threshold models (testing experiment-level missingness), and association analysis of data missingness and phenotypic traits.
